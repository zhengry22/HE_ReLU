# HE_ReLU
For CSNOVA, 2024 summer, a program using the HE lib troy-nova to encrypt ReLU function.

## Next step
    * I have basically gotten the hang of how to utilize troy for CKKS, next job is to link Polynomial with CKKS.
    * The current way of poly-approximation is using Taylor's equation, but it does not have a very good effect. I may consider using Remez algorithm instead, which I haven't learnt how to use it yet.
